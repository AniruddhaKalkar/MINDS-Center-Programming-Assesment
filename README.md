# MINDS-Center-Programming-Assesment
Programming exercise is to demonstrate my ability to design a solution to a problem and implement this solution in Python using software engineering best practices.

### I have included both the python notebook and a python script in the project. 
Both files do essentially the same task. The notebook might be useful to glance at the results and analysis without running the entire script because the input file isn't small.


## Instructions for Running the Code

### Installing required packages
Run the following command

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Python Notebook
Note:  Make sure that the result.json file is in the same directory as the python notebook
Run all cells

### Running the Python Script
1. If the input file has the name result.json and is in the current directory 

    python sentiment_analysis.py 
    
2. If you want to specify the path to the json file

    python sentiment_analysis.py --inputfile result.json
